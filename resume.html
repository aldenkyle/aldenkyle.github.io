                            <h2 style="color:#f75d5d;">Professional Summary </h2>
							 <p><span class="image left"><img src="assets/Headshot@4x.png"  alt="" /></span> <b>Professional Summary: </b> <br>I am  a recognized subject matter expert in spatial data analytics, data management, and spatial visualization in the US Government. I currently serve as the Geospatial Specialist at the US Agency for International Development’s Bureau for Resilience and Food Security where I develop analytic processes and tools to inform development programming, manage the Bureau’s spatial data, and support analytic efforts to inform our flagship Feed the Future initiative. Before joining USAID, I spent twelve years as an analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency where I provided unique insight to intelligence questions by applying geographic methods as both an analyst and a program lead and was promoted to GS-14.  I love problem solving with data throughout the analytic lifecycle: from gathering and managing, analyzing and innovating, to designing beautiful cartographic products. </p> <br>
